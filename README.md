# Forgotten World

**Forgotten World** is a small open-world MMORPG hobby project, currently about 2% done.

Made with C++ and SFML, it’s a personal learning project aiming to slowly build a fun MMO world — nothing fancy yet, just laying the groundwork.

---

## Current Progress  
- Main menu and game state system (core engine basics)  
- Player and entity classes  
- Movable character you can control  
- Inventory UI that appears when pressing `I` (non-functional so far)  

---

## Why This Project?  
Just a passion project to explore game dev and share the journey with others interested in MMORPGs.

---

## Want to Help?  
If you’re into C++, SFML, or just curious about making MMOs, I’d love your help!  
Whether it’s coding, art, or ideas — contributions and discussions are very welcome.

Let’s build this little world together, one step at a time :)
